# Find Events In The US

In this project, we created an interactive map that allows users to explore a list of entertainment events (sports, music concerts, etc. provided by Ticketmaster) based on selected cities/markets in the United States.

## NOTE: Our project is 100% hosted here on the web, not just running on our local machines.
